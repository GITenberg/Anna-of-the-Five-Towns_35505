description: 'In Anna of the Five Towns (1902) Arnold Bennett depicts the severe economic
  and moral pressures of life in the Potteries in the late nineteenth century, as
  they affect the emotional fortunes of his heroine. When Anna Tellwright comes of
  age, she learns from her miserly father that she is rich, and discovers for herself
  that she is loved by two men: popular, charismatic, and successful Henry Mynors,
  and awkward Willie Price. The novel presents her resistance to her father against
  the background of pottery manufacture and the repressive regime of Methodism.'
